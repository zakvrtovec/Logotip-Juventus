This project showcases the creation of logos using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The process began with downloading PNG logo images from the internet, converting them into SVG paths using GIMP, and enhancing the rendering with custom JavaScript to handle Bezier curves. This project aims to demonstrate how to use vector graphics (SVGs) on the web while implementing custom functionality for more dynamic and interactive logo displays.
